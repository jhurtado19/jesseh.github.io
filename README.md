# Iris Dataset by Fisher (1936) 
[This data set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris) is of particular interest because of its historical relevance and universal adaptability to modern classification methods. This data set was one of the first data sets that was employed to evaluate classification methods, and is found in many textbooks concerned with machine learning. Its simplicity, small size, and structure make it highly suitable and adaptable for testing classic classifcation methods, of which nearly all have been tried on this data set, each achieving varying levels of accuracy. It was an important stepping stone on the journey of the development of machine learning, and can still be used today to train new models, highlight strengths and suitability for real world applications.

## The data set.
  The data itself consists of tabular data, each row corresponding to an individual iris sample for three iris species, examining 4 features of each sample. The objective of the classifcation methods is then to learn to distinguish the iris samples based on the features, totalling 150 samples, 50 of each species.
