# Iris Dataset by Fisher (1936) 
[This data set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris) is of particular interest because of its historical relevance and universal adaptability to modern classification methods. This data set was one of the first data sets that was employed to evaluate classification methods, and is found in many textbooks concerned with machine learning. Its simplicity, small size, and structure make it highly suitable and adaptable for testing classic classifcation methods, of which nearly all have been tried on this data set, each achieving varying levels of accuracy. It was an important stepping stone on the journey of the development of machine learning, and can still be used today to train new models, highlight strengths and suitability for real world applications.

## The data set.
  The data itself consists of tabular data, each row corresponding to an individual iris sample for three iris species, examining 4 features of each sample. The objective of the classifcation methods is then to learn to distinguish the iris samples based on the features, totalling 150 samples, 50 of each species. 

# [Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)
This book, Deep Learning, by Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville,
is a book that covers the fundamentals of Deep Learning and Machine learning. In each chapter, it systematically presents a relevant layer of information that develops an understanding of machine learning from first principles, linear algebra, and statistics, and synthesizes this knowledge to construct the concept of machine learning, and the underlying deep learning. 

I am excited to read it because I want to tackle the concepts of machine learning and deep learning head on, and expose myself to the fundamentals, master them, and develop a healthy understanding of these concepts and their applications.
